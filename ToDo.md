# Plan
- **Optimisitc** 
	- Expand Simple-NIDS to be able to intake any pcap file and give option to:
		- Set individual training set and testing set
		- Split a single pcap into a training and testing set
	- Option to run tests for an existing model or create a new model and test it
		- After test data is shown for new models give option to save it
	- Option to use existing model for realtime test
		- Give real time graphs and charts when using this option
	- Get working LSTM, KNN and Naive Bayes
		- LSTM kinda works but we will need to see observability in order to check why not fully
