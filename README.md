# Simple-NIDS
This is an implementation of a simple Network Intrusion Detection System

# Running
Needs to be run on a linux distro. Windows does not allow for the socket module from python to grab packets at a low 
enough level.
Windows restricts to higher level packet captures and this system needs the packet headers to operate, which are found 
at the base level.
